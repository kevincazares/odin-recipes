    <h1>Deep-fried tofu that is crisp and golden brown on the outside and amazingly white and soft on the inside!</h1>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap tofu in a clean towel and place onto a plate. Set another plate on top, and place a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for about 20 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid.</li>
        <li>Cut tofu into 1-inch by 2-inch chunks. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt onto one slide; flip over and sprinkle remaining 1/4 teaspoon on the other.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or large skillet. To test if the oil is ready, dip a chopstick or wooden spoon in it; if bubbles rise, it is ready. If the oil smokes, it is too hot.</li>
        <li>Gently place 5 to 8 pieces of tofu at a time in hot oil using metal tongs. Be very careful as oil may splatter; use a splatter guard if possible. Fry tofu until golden, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain tofu on a plate lined with several paper towels. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
