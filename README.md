# odin-recipes

This project is to improve my basic skills as a web developer. While doing this project, I learned the basics of HTML structure through hands-on practice. I created a simple recipe website with an index page linking to individual recipe pages. The project tought me how to structure an HTML document, add headings, images, links, lists. Additionally, I gained further practice in version control with Git and GitHub, learned how to organize and publish my work online.
